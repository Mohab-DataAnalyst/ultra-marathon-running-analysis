# 🏃 Ultra-Marathon Running Data Cleaning and EDA Python Project

This project focuses on **cleaning and analyzing ultra-marathon race data, specifically for 50km and 50mi races in the USA from 2020**. The goal is to prepare the dataset for meaningful insights and visualizations.  

## 🚀 How It Works

- The dataset is loaded and filtered based on race criteria.  
- Data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and types are corrected.  
- Visualizations using **Seaborn** provide insights into race trends.  
- Performance differences by distance, gender, and season are analyzed.  
## 📌 Key Objectives
1️⃣ **Data Cleaning**:
- Filter dataset to include only USA races (50km & 50mi) from 2020.  
- Standardize event names and distances.  
- Handle missing values and drop unnecessary columns.  
- Convert data types for accurate analysis.   



2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Identify trends in athlete performance.  
   - Analyze age groups and their impact on race performance.  
   - Compare gender-based performance differences.  
   - Evaluate seasonal effects on athlete speed.  


  3️⃣ **Data Visualization**:
- Average Speed by Gender & Distance
- Top Performing Age Groups
- Performance Trends Across Seasons
## 🔍Key Findings
- Male and female performance differences exist across 50km and 50mi races.
- The fastest age groups vary, with different performance trends in 50mi races.
- Seasonal trends impact athlete performance, with variations across different times of the year.
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core programming language
- **Pandas** – For data cleaning & transformation
- **Seaborn** – For visualization
